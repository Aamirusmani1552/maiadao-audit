## Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues

Automated findings output for the audit can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia/bot-report.md) within 24 hours of audit opening.

*Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in the automated findings output is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards.*

### Publicly Known Issues

- Some chains may demand different block timestamp settings.
- Using your Virtual Account as refundee for a the creation of cross-chain messages with or without settlement attached as well as retrySettlement or retryDeposit will result in gas refunds of excess gas on branch chains being inaccessible since the refundee is not an EOA able to claim receive the funds on any branch chain.
- Floating pragma, code will be deployed with 0.8.19.
- There are contracts that allow to renounce ownership and do not override renounceOwnership function from solady library.
- Our protocol has permissionless factories where anyone can create with for example deposit poison erc20 tokens in ports or create malicious routers. While contracts generated by these are not in scope, if it does affect other contracts or other balances, it is in scope.

# Overview

Maia DAO V2 Ecosytem docs section that explains the business logic and technical references for Ulysses Protocol, can be found [here](https://v2-docs.maiadao.io/protocols/Ulysses/introduction/).

### Ulysses

**[Ulysses](https://v2-docs.maiadao.io/protocols/Ulysses/introduction)** scope for this audit focuses on Ulysses Omnichain our Liquidity and Execution Platform built on top of Layer Zero.

This can be divided in two main features:

1. **[Virtualized liquidity](https://v2-docs.maiadao.io/protocols/Ulysses/overview/omnichain/virtual-liquidity)** is achieved by connecting [Ports](https://v2-docs.maiadao.io/protocols/Ulysses/overview/omnichain/ports) within a Pool and Spoke architecture, comprising both the Root Chain and multiple Branch Chains. These contracts are responsible for managing token balances and address mappings across environments. In addition, means that an asset deposited from a specific chain, is recognized as a different asset from the "same" asset but from a different chain (ex: arb ETH is different from mainnet ETH).

2. **Arbitrary Cross-Chain Execution** is facilitated by an expandable set of routers such as the Multicall Root Router that can be permissionlessly deployed through the Bridge Agent Factories. For more insight on Bridge Agents, please refer to our documentation [here](https://v2-docs.maiadao.io/protocols/Ulysses/overview/omnichain/bridge-agents). Our [Virtual Account](https://v2-docs.maiadao.io/protocols/Ulysses/overview/omnichain/virtual-accounts) contract simplifies remote asset management and interaction within the Root chain.

## Areas of Concern

While this audit has all the Ulysses Omnichain components and features in scope, there are specific concerns that we would like to highlight for the wardens to pay special attention to. These are:

- BranchPort's Strategy Token and Port Strategy related functions.
- Omnichain balance accounting.
- Omnichain execution management aspects, particularly related to transaction nonce retry, as well as the retrieve and redeem patterns:
  1. `srChain` settlement and deposits should either have `status` set to `STATUS_SUCCESS` and `STATUS_FAILED` depending on their redeemability by the user on the source.
  2. `dstChain` settlement and deposit execution should have `executionState` set to `STATUS_READY`, `STATUS_DONE` or `STATUS_RETRIEVE` according to user input fallback and destination execution outcome.

## Out of scope

Everything out of ["src"](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia/tree/main/src) is out of scope, namely ["lib"](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia/tree/main/lib) and ["test"](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia/tree/main/test).

# Additional Context

### Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts
Branch / Root Bridge Agent and Bridge Agent Executor packed payload decoding and encoding.

### Please list specific ERC20 that your protocol is anticipated to interact with. Could be "any" (literally anything, fee on transfer tokens, ERC777 tokens and so forth) or a list of tokens you envision using on launch.
Arbitrum's deployment of UniswapV3 and Balancer.

### Please list specific ERC721 that your protocol is anticipated to interact with.
Virtual Account should be able to keep and use UniswapV3 NFT's.

### Which blockchains will this code be deployed to, and are considered in scope for this audit?
Root contracts are to be deployed on Arbitrum and Branch contracts in several L1 and L2 networks such as Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Base and Optimism

### Please list all trusted roles (e.g. operators, slashers, pausers, etc.), the privileges they hold, and any conditions under which privilege escalation is expected/allowable:
Only our governance has access to key admin state changing functions present in the `RootPort` and `CoreRootRouter` and the Root Bridge Agent deployer (referred to in the codebase as manager) is responsible for allowing new branch chains to connect to their Root Bridge Agent in order to prevent griefing.

### In the event of a DOS, could you outline a minimum duration after which you would consider a finding to be valid? This question is asked in the context of most systems' capacity to handle DoS attacks gracefully for a certain period.
Unless there is the need to upgrade and migrate any component of Ulysses via governance ( e.g. Bridge Agents or Core Routers) downtime should be negligible to ensure assets are available at any time to their different users.

### Is any part of your implementation intended to conform to any EIP's? If yes, please list the contracts in this format:
  - `ERC20hTokenBranch`: Should comply with `ERC20/EIP20`
  - `ERC20hTokenRoot`: Should comply with `ERC20/EIP20`

## Attack ideas (Where to look for bugs)

- Double spending of deposit and settlement nonces / assets (Bridge Agents and Bridge Agent Executors).
- Griefing of user deposits and settlements (Bridge Agents).
- Bricking of Bridge Agent and subsequent Omnichain dApps that rely on it.
- Circumventing Bridge Agent's encoding rules to manipulate remote chain state.

## Main invariants

- The total balance of any given Virtualized Liquidity Token should never be greater than the amount of Underlying Tokens deposited in the asset's origin chain Branch Port.
- A Deposit / Settlement can never be redeemable and retryable at the same time.

## Scoping Details

```
- If you have a public code repo, please share it here:
- How many contracts are in scope?:  50
- Total SLoC for these contracts?:  4281

- Is this either a fork of or an alternate implementation of another project?:   No
- Does it use a side-chain?: True
- Describe any specific areas you would like addressed: Please try to break token deposits and settlements patterns - retry, retrieve, and redeem - to avoid double spending, reentrancy and race conditions. Ensure proper asset management of different ports. Encoding and decoding of cross-chain payloads/data on bridge agents and routers.
```

# Tests

**Here is an example of a full script to run the first time you build the contracts in both Windows and Linux:**

- Remove `.example` from the provided `.env` file and edit the uncommented `RPC` and `RPC_API_KEY` values to your preferences. These values will be used by our fork testing suite.

```bash
forge install
forge build
forge test --gas-report
forge snapshot --diff
```

Default gas price is 10,000, but you can change it by adding `--gas-price <gas price>` to the command or by setting the `gas_price` property in the [foundry.toml](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia/tree/main/foundry.toml) file.

### Install and First Build

Install libraries using forge and compile contracts.

```bash
forge install
forge build
```

## Slither

If you encounter any issues, please update slither to [0.9.3](https://github.com/crytic/slither/releases/tag/0.9.3), the latest version at the moment.

To run [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) from root, please specify the src directory.

```bash
slither "./src/*"
```

We have a [slither config](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia/tree/main/slither.config.json) file that turns on optimization and adds forge remappings.

The output is provided in [./slither.txt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia/tree/main/slither.txt)
